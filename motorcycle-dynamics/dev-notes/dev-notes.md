Here's a step-by-step plan to design and build your free-body diagram designer and simulator:

1. **Design the User Interface (UI):**
   - Define the area where the user will design the structure. This could be the entire screen or a portion of it.
   - Define the controls that the user will use to add nodes and beams to the structure. This could be done through mouse clicks or drag-and-drop.
   - Define the controls that the user will use to apply loads and forces to the nodes and beams. This could be done through a form where the user enters the magnitude and direction of the force, or through a graphical interface where the user drags arrows to apply the forces.

2. **Implement the UI:**
   - Use Pygame's drawing functions to draw the design area and controls.
   - Use Pygame's event handling to detect when the user interacts with the controls.

3. **Implement the Structure Design:**
   - Create a data structure to represent the nodes and beams in the structure. This could be a graph where the nodes are vertices and the beams are edges.
   - When the user adds a node or beam, add it to the data structure and redraw the design area.
   - When the user removes a node or beam, remove it from the data structure and redraw the design area.

4. **Implement the Force Application:**
   - Create a data structure to represent the forces applied to the nodes and beams. This could be a dictionary where the keys are nodes or beams and the values are vectors representing the forces.
   - When the user applies a force, add it to the data structure and redraw the design area.
   - When the user removes a force, remove it from the data structure and redraw the design area.

5. **Implement the Simulation:**
   - Use a physics engine or implement your own physics calculations to calculate the effects of the forces on the structure.
   - Redraw the design area to show the effects of the forces. This could involve deforming the beams, moving the nodes, or changing the colors to indicate stress.

6. **Test the Application:**
   - Test the application with a variety of structures and forces to ensure that it behaves correctly.
   - Fix any bugs that you find and make any necessary improvements to the UI or physics calculations.

7. **Release the Application:**
   - Package the application for distribution.
   - Write documentation explaining how to use the application.
   - Release the application to users.

Remember, this is a complex project that involves many different aspects of programming, including UI design, data structures, event handling, physics calculations, and more. It's important to break the project down into manageable parts and tackle each one individually.
